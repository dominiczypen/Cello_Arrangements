# Arrangements for 2 or more cellos and other instruments

Arrangements for cellos. Feel free to use! They were all created using the
open source software LilyPond (a TeX derivative). True to TeX spirit, you
enter plain text source code, compile, get a bunch of errors first, and finally
end up with a beautiful PDF output (plus a MIDI file!).

Source files are in .ly format. Feel free to modify. If you like any of the pieces, I am always
happy to hear from you at <first_name> dot zypen at gmail!
